### RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the analysis, here are some tailored recommendations for a business owner looking to enhance engagement on TikTok:

* Optimal Posting Time;To maximize your reach and engagement, the best time to post is between **7 PM and 10 PM**. This time window is when your audience is most active.

* Use of Voiceovers; Your voice is a powerful asset. Leverage it by using voiceovers in your posts. Your voice sounds convincing and engaging, so be mindful of your word choices and pitch to create a stronger connection with your audience.

* Adding Descriptions and Captions;  While itâ€™s beneficial to always include descriptions in your posts, our analysis shows that captions do not significantly impact engagement. Therefore, prioritize crafting engaging descriptions, but don't worry too much about captions boosting your interaction levels.
